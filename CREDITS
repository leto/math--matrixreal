Many people deserve recoginition for their help with Math::MatrixReal:

* 	Many thanks to Steffen Beyer <sb@engelschall.com> himself for being very 
	open to third-party additions. (Of course, this acknowledgment is due to Rodolphe. :-)
	Steffen Beyer released the original Math::MatrixReal and maintained it
	until v1.3a5, then handed off to Jonathan Leto <jonathan@leto.net>.

* 	Rodolphe Ortalo <ortalo@laas.fr> for many contributions.

*	As always, many thanks to Andreas Koenig <andreas.koenig@mind.de>
	for his relentless support and efforts as upload manager of the CPAN!

*	Also many thanks to Stu Smith <stu@cs.uml.edu> for raising the questions
	concerning the "new_from_string()" method (whose documentation was mis-
	leading and incomplete)!

*	Mike South <msouth@fulcrum.org> for the new_from_cols() and new_from_rows() functions
	that were integrated from Math::MatrixReal::Ext1

*   Alberto Sim√µes <ambs@cpan.org> for contributions.

*	Everybody involved with CPAN Testers, thanks guys/gals!
