----------------------------
    * Fixed the overloading for the division operator which did not recognize $a/2, reported
	by Daniel Brooks <db48x@yahoo.com>
    * Added support for matrix division notation, so that $a/$b = $a*$b**(-1) when $a and $b are square matrices
    * t/div.t created

Changes in v2.01 - msouth
Fri Aug 19 23:40:24 EDT 2005
----------------------------
    * Changed versioning format to leading zero after the
      dot to make more minor versions possible this time
    * Integration of Math::MatrixReal::Ext1 0.07
        * merged new_from_cols and new_from_rows into one private
          function which is called by wrappers with the old
          names
        * added tests to exercise all of the known failure modes
          in new_from_{rows,cols} calls
    * Fixes for POD
        * added a much needed =over 4 to the start of the POD
        * removed tabs
    * reformatted indentation of the all of the code to 4 space
      indent (from a mixture of tabs, 8 space, 4 space, and 2 space)

Changes in v1.6 -- leto
Sat Feb 16 09:46:51 EST 2002 
-------------------------

Changes in v1.5 -- leto
Sat Jan 12 04:20:48 EST 2002 
-------------------------
	* t/inverse.t test 6 was numerically instable, commented out
		I ran it 10000 times and got values from 1e-2 to 1e-16,
		this caused the test to randomly fail, because it checked
		that the value was less than 1e-10
		I did not notice this problem because my default perl install
		has USE_LONG_DOUBLE
	* changed epsilon to be 1e-8 in funcs.pl ( was 1e-10)
